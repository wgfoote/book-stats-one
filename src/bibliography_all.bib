 abstract = {Activities (or production processes) are considered as building blocks out of which a technology is constructed. Postulates are developed by which activities may be combined. The main part of the paper is concerned with the discrete type model and the use of a linear maximization function for finding the "optimum" program. The mathematical problem associated with this approach is developed first in general notation and then in term sof a dynamic system of equations expressed in matrix notation. Typical problems from the fields of inter-industryrelations, transportation nutrition, warehouse storage, and air transport are given in the last section.},

abstract = {This paper presents an operational metric for univariate unimodal probability distributions with finite first moments in [0,1], where 0 is maximally thin-tailed (Gaussian) and 1 is maximally fat-tailed. It is based on the question, “how much data does one need to make meaningful statements about a given dataset?” Applications: Among others, it •helps to determine the sample size n needed for statistical significance outside the Gaussian distribution,•helps to measure the speed of convergence to the Gaussian (or stable basin),•allows practical comparisons across classes of fat-tailed distributions,•allows the number of securities needed in portfolio construction to achieve a certain level of risk-reduction from diversification to be assessed,•helps in assessing risks under various settings, and•helps to explain some inconsistent attributes of the lognormal, depending on the parametrization of its variance. The literature in regard to asymptotic behavior is rich, but there is a large void regarding finite values of n, which are those that are needed for operational purposes. Background: Conventional measures of fat-tailedness, namely (1) the tail index for the power law class, and (2) the kurtosis for finite moment distributions, fail to apply to some distributions, and do not allow comparisons across classes and parametrization; that is, between power laws outside the Levy-stable basin, or power laws and distributions in other classes, or power laws for different numbers of summands. How can one compare a sum of 100 Student t distributed random variables with three degrees of freedom to one in a Levy-stable or a Lognormal class? How can one compare a sum of 100 Student t with three degrees of freedom to a single Student t with two degrees of freedom? We propose an operational and heuristic metric that allows us to compare n-summed independent variables under all distributions with finite first moments. The method is based on the rate of convergence of the law of large numbers for finite sums, specifically n-summands. We get either explicit expressions or simulation results and bounds for the lognormal, exponential, Pareto, and Student t distributions in their various calibrations, in addition to the general Pearson classes.}

    abstract = { The dialectic is a very ancient device long used to comprehend historical process. Its versatility as a tool for informing on numerous issues of interest to those involved in futures studies is self-evident yet under-appreciated, not as a predicting device but as a framing one, much as with how catalysts work in chemistry. This piece first briefly describes the basics of the dialectical process and its application as an outcome framing method. Its connections with other forecasting methods especially with emerging issues analysis is discussed. The properties of dialectical processes are dynamic and do not necessarily conform to human-scale either temporally or spatially. Dialectical process related to social change and worldview are not subordinate to cyclic time except when artificially imposed as with political elections. The dialectical process being consistent with quantum mechanics especially as applied to technological impacts and legal enactment process will be discussed. In the latter instance, the dark matter and dark energy conundrum bear the hallmarks of a dialectical process thus far leading to an indeterminable resolution. While several examples of persistent issue contradictions to which dialectical analysis can be usefully applied are available, American health care policy is highlighted here. }

Reflecting the need for scripting in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling work.  The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding.  The second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal inference, integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also contains new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with an entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing how domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses.  Features   Integrates working code into the main text   Illustrates concepts through worked data analysis examples   Emphasizes understanding assumptions and how assumptions are reflected in code   Offers more detailed explanations of the mathematics in optional sections   Presents examples of using the dagitty R package to analyze causal graphs   Provides the rethinking R package on the author's website and on GitHub},

We analyze with various estimators how these relationships are affected by foreign aid flows by focusing on 78 developing countries for 1984-2008. Both types of terrorism are found to depress FDI. Aggregate aid mitigates the negative consequences of domestic and transnational terrorism, but this aid appears more robust in ameliorating the adverse effect of domestic terrorism. However, when aid is subdivided, bilateral aid is effective in reducing the adverse effects of transnational terrorism on FDI, whereas multilateral aid is effective in curbing the adverse effects of domestic terrorism on FDI. For transnational terrorism, there is evidence in the literature that donor countries earmark some bilateral aid to counterterrorism. Aid ability to curb the risk to FDI from terrorism is important because FDI is an important engine of development.}",

These data sets are then used to display some stylized facts about domestic and transnational terrorism during the past four decades. Next, some essential strategic distinctions are drawn between defensive and proactive measures in the case of transnational terrorism when multiple countries are confronted by a common terrorist group. These strategic concerns vanish for domestic terrorism as a central government is able to internalize potential externalities.

The method, called Interactive Sequential Goal Programming (ISGP), combines and extends the attractive features of both Goal Programming and interactive solution approaches for MODM problems. ISGP is applicable to both linear and non-linear problems. It uses existing single objective optimization techniques and, hence, available computer codes utilizing these techniques can be adapted for use in ISGP. The non-dominance of the "best-compromise" solution is assured. The information required from the decision maker in each iteration is simple. The proposed method is illustrated by solving a nutrition problem.},
